When we are talking about large e-commerce like Amazon, it is an impossible task to perform the analysis on customer reviews manually. That is where the Natural Language Processing shines. Using state-of-the-art deep learning methods we can efficiently summarize the customer reviews and have cleaner data to work on tasks like a sentimental analysis.\n",

Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins.\n",
