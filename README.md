# Summarization of Amazon Musical Instruments Reviews Using Deep Learning (LSTM)

In this notebook, I summarized Amazon Musical Instrument Reviews using a deep learning abstractive based method in Keras.

Frequently, customer reviews are long and complex text data. When we are talking about large e-commerce like Amazon, it is an impossible task to perform the analysis on customer reviews manually. That is where the Natural Language Processing shines. Using state-of-the-art deep learning methods we can efficiently summarize the customer reviews and have cleaner data to work on tasks like a sentimental analysis.

Also, we compared the performance of the summarizer with the summary provided by the dataset.

We used a dataset that you can find in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/eswarchandt/amazon-music-reviews).
